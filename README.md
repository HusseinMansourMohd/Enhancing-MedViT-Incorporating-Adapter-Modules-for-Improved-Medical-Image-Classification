# Enhancing MedViT: Incorporating Adapter Modules for Improved Medical Image Datasets.

### Description:

This project aims to improve the performance of the MedViT model, a robust Vision Transformer (ViT) optimized for small medical datasets, by incorporating Adapter Modules. Unlike the typical application of ViT which requires large datasets, our implementation focuses on maximizing performance with smaller, more specific datasets that are typical in medical applications.

Adapters are small neural network modules that are introduced in between the main layers of a transformer-based model. They enable the model to adapt its internal representations to better cater to the task or dataset. By adding these adapters, we aim to increase the model's flexibility and capacity to learn complex features, thereby enhancing its classification performance.

This project involves modifying the original MedViT model architecture to include these adapter layers, training the adapted model with our specific medical datasets, and assessing the impact of these additions on model performance in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and recall.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of adapter modules in improving the performance of Vision Transformers, even when dealing with smaller datasets. This approach will provide significant benefits in the field of medical image analysis, enabling more accurate and reliable diagnoses and predictions.

### MedNIST Dataset:
The MedNIST dataset is a collection of medical images spanning six categories. These categories include Hand, Abdomen, Chest, HeadCT, BreastMRI, and CXR (Chest X-ray). It is a balanced dataset, with an equal number of images in each category, which makes it a suitable choice for classification tasks.

The MedNIST dataset was compiled from several larger, publicly available datasets, including the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset and the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, among others.

Here are some more details about the dataset:

Number of Classes: The MedNIST dataset includes six classes: Hand, Abdomen, Chest, HeadCT, BreastMRI, and CXR (Chest X-ray).

Number of Images: There are typically 10,000 images for each class, resulting in a total of approximately 60,000 images.

Image Size: All the images are 64x64 grayscale images.

Balance of Classes: The dataset is balanced, meaning it contains an equal number of images for each class.

Preprocessing: The images have been preprocessed to a standard size and grayscale format for easier use.

The MedNIST dataset is commonly used in medical image classification tasks as it covers a range of imaging types found in the medical field. It is also an easily accessible dataset that is helpful for training and validating machine learning models, especially for those new to medical image analysis. However, it should be noted that real-world medical datasets are often much more complex and unbalanced.


# update on the work??????

1.MedVit_adapter model: I assumed that all the necessary modules (like ECB, LTB, SpatialPriorModule, InteractionBlock, and MSDeformAttn) and helper functions (like deform_inputs, trunc_normal_, normal_) are implemented and imported correctly, as they are not standard PyTorch modules or functions. If not, you need to ensure their correct implementation and importation.

2.Pretrained weights: You have included pretrained as an argument in your model registry functions but have not used it inside the function. Typically, this flag is used to load pretrained weights into your model. If you plan to use pretrained weights, you will need to implement the logic to load these weights when pretrained=True.

3.Hyperparameters: There are quite a few hyperparameters in your model. Make sure the values you are providing are sensible for your task, and that all hyperparameters are being passed to the model where needed.

4.Training and Evaluation: This code only covers the model architecture. To train the model, you will need to create a training loop where the model weights are updated, and an evaluation loop where the model's performance is assessed. You'll also need a loss function, an optimizer, and potentially a learning rate scheduler.

5.Dataset: Ensure that you have the correct data loading and preprocessing mechanisms in place. The data should be in the correct format to be fed into your model.
