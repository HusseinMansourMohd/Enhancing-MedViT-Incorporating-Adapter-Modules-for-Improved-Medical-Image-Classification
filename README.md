# Enhancing MedViT: Incorporating Adapter Modules for Improved Medical Image Classification

### Description:

This project aims to improve the performance of the MedViT model, a robust Vision Transformer (ViT) optimized for small medical datasets, by incorporating Adapter Modules. Unlike the typical application of ViT which requires large datasets, our implementation focuses on maximizing performance with smaller, more specific datasets that are typical in medical applications.

Adapters are small neural network modules that are introduced in between the main layers of a transformer-based model. They enable the model to adapt its internal representations to better cater to the task or dataset. By adding these adapters, we aim to increase the model's flexibility and capacity to learn complex features, thereby enhancing its classification performance.

This project involves modifying the original MedViT model architecture to include these adapter layers, training the adapted model with our specific medical datasets, and assessing the impact of these additions on model performance in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and recall.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of adapter modules in improving the performance of Vision Transformers, even when dealing with smaller datasets. This approach will provide significant benefits in the field of medical image analysis, enabling more accurate and reliable diagnoses and predictions.
